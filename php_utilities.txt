A code analyzer that checks if the code tries to access any previously uninitialized variables and flags them out

    e.g. if I declare and assign values to '$result' and later I mistakenly try to access '$results', it will flag that out as a warning

Also check if all html elements have been properly closed:
    e.g. <form>,<table>,<tr>,<th>
